# 🏠 Exploratory Data Analysis on New York Airbnb Listings

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset of Airbnb listings in the New York. The goal is to uncover insights into pricing, availability, host behavior, and location-based trends using Python.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Handled missing values (e.g., in `reviews_per_month`)
- Removed duplicates and invalid rows
- Transformed data types 
- Filtered extreme outliers based on price and availability

## 📈 Key Analysis Performed

- **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution of price, room types, reviews
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Correlation between price and number of reviews, availability, etc.
- **Outlier Detection**: Using boxplots for price and availability
- **Neighborhood Analysis**: Which areas have the most listings and highest prices
- **Room Type Trends**: How different room types affect price and availability

- ## 📌 Key Insights

- Entire homes/apartments have significantly higher prices than private/shared rooms
- Neighborhood and room type are strong influencers of listing price
- Many listings show inflated prices with low availability (possibly inactive hosts)
- Certain neighborhoods are overcrowded while others are underutilized

  ## ✅ Outcome

This EDA project demonstrates the ability to:
- Work with real-world, messy datasets
- Extract insights from raw data
- Apply visual analytics to support business decisions
